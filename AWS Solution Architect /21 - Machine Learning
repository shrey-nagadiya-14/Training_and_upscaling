                          PUBLISH                       BLOCK
```

### Confidence Threshold:

WHAT IS CONFIDENCE?
- Rekognition returns a confidence score (0-100%)
- Higher = more certain
- Example: "Nudity detected with 95% confidence"

SET MINIMUM THRESHOLD:
- You decide what confidence level triggers action
- Example: Flag all content with >70% confidence for review
- Higher threshold = fewer false positives, might miss some
- Lower threshold = catch more, more false positives

EXAMPLE:
```
Image Analysis Result:
- "Violence": 85% confidence
- "Weapons": 72% confidence

Your Threshold: 80%

Action: Flag "Violence" for review (85% > 80%)
        Don't flag "Weapons" (72% < 80%)
```

### Amazon Augmented AI (A2I):

WHAT IS A2I?
- Human review for uncertain cases
- When AI is not confident enough
- Manual approval/rejection

WORKFLOW:
1. Rekognition analyzes image
2. Confidence is between thresholds (uncertain)
3. Image sent to A2I
4. Human reviewer makes decision

## 6. AMAZON POLLY - LEXICON & SSML

### Concept:
Customize how Amazon Polly pronounces words using Pronunciation Lexicons 
and control speech output using SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language).

### PRONUNCIATION LEXICONS:

### What is a Lexicon?
A dictionary that tells Polly how to pronounce specific words.

CUSTOMIZE PRONUNCIATION FOR:

1. STYLIZED WORDS
   - St3ph4ne → Pronounce as "Stephane"
   - L33t → Pronounce as "Leet"
   - @home → Pronounce as "at home"

2. ACRONYMS
   - AWS → Pronounce as "Amazon Web Services"
   - CEO → Pronounce as "Chief Executive Officer"
   - API → Pronounce as "Application Programming Interface"

3. TECHNICAL TERMS
   - kubectl → Pronounce as "kube control"
   - nginx → Pronounce as "engine x"

4. BRAND NAMES
   - Your company name
   - Product names
   - Industry-specific terms

### How to Use Lexicons:

```
STEP 1: Create Lexicon
{
  "grapheme": "AWS",
  "alias": "Amazon Web Services"
}

STEP 2: Upload to Polly
polly.put_lexicon(Name='my-lexicon', Content=lexicon_content)

STEP 3: Use in SynthesizeSpeech
polly.synthesize_speech(
  Text="Welcome to AWS",
  LexiconNames=['my-lexicon'],
  ...
)

RESULT: "Welcome to Amazon Web Services" (spoken)
```

### SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language):

### What is SSML?
XML-based markup language to control how Polly generates speech.

SSML CAPABILITIES:

1. EMPHASIZING WORDS
   ```xml
   <speak>
     I <emphasis level="strong">really</emphasis> like this!
   </speak>
   ```

2. PHONETIC PRONUNCIATION
   ```xml
   <speak>
     <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="pɪˈkɑːn">pecan</phoneme>
   </speak>
   ```

3. BREATHING SOUNDS
   ```xml
   <speak>
     <amazon:breath duration="medium" volume="loud"/>
     Hello there!
   </speak>
   ```

4. WHISPERING
   ```xml
   <speak>
     <amazon:effect name="whispered">
       This is a secret
     </amazon:effect>
   </speak>
   ```

5. NEWSCASTER STYLE
   ```xml
   <speak>
     <amazon:domain name="news">
       Today in financial news, stocks rose sharply.
     </amazon:domain>
   </speak>
   ```

6. PAUSES
   ```xml
   <speak>
     Hello. <break time="2s"/> How are you?
   </speak>
   ```

7. SPEAKING RATE
   ```xml
   <speak>
     <prosody rate="slow">
       Let me explain this slowly.
     </prosody>
   </speak>
   ```

8. PITCH AND VOLUME
   ```xml
   <speak>
     <prosody pitch="high" volume="loud">
       This is exciting!
     </prosody>
   </speak>
   ```

### Real-Life Example:
Think of Lexicons and SSML as VOICE COACHING for Polly:

WITHOUT CUSTOMIZATION:
- Polly reads text literally
- "AWS" pronounced as "aws" (wrong!)
- Monotone delivery
- No emotion or emphasis

WITH LEXICONS + SSML:
- Correct pronunciation of terms
- Natural pauses and breathing
- Emotional emphasis
- Professional delivery
- Sounds like a real person

### Use Case Example:

NEWS ARTICLE READER:
```xml
<speak>
  <amazon:domain name="news">
    Breaking news from <say-as interpret-as="spell-out">AWS</say-as>.
    <break time="500ms"/>
    Amazon <emphasis level="strong">announced</emphasis> today that
    <prosody rate="medium">
      they are launching a new service.
    </prosody>
    <amazon:breath/>
    More details at 11.
  </amazon:domain>
</speak>
```

Result: Natural-sounding news broadcast!

### Daily Use Cases:

LEXICONS:
✓ Company-specific terminology
✓ Medical terms pronunciation
✓ Legal jargon
✓ Foreign names
✓ Technical acronyms

SSML:
✓ Professional voice overs
✓ Dynamic emphasis in alerts
✓ Emotional storytelling
✓ Training materials with pauses
✓ Meditation apps (slow, calm)

✓ Implement in DAYS, not months
✓ No ML expertise required

### How It Works:

```
PERSONALIZATION ARCHITECTURE:

DATA SOURCES                 AMAZON PERSONALIZE           OUTPUT CHANNELS

Amazon S3        ─┐                                      
(historical      │ read data                              Websites & Apps
 data)           │ from S3                                     │
                 ├─────────────→ ┌───────────────────┐         │
                 │               │    Amazon         │ ────────┤
Amazon           │               │   Personalize     │         │
Personalize API ─┘ real-time    │                   │ ────────┤→ Mobile Apps

                 ──────────────→ └───────────────────┘         │
                                                               └→ Emails
```

### Example:

USER BEHAVIOR:
